### Welcome To Tarkov!

This character is themed around the game Escape From Tarkov. Start out as a hatchet runner, and take on increasingly difficult enemies. Enemies can drop items and equipment. Additionally, each round has a chance for a scav boss to spawn as a patrol. These bosses are very difficult, but will always drop some kind of item.
